Linked Lists
- Singly linked lists have pointers to next node
- Doubly linked lists have pointers to next and previous nodes
- May use runner where two pointers iterate simultaneously

Binary Tree
- Have left, right and parent pointers
- Binary search trees good for searching
- Balanced binary trees are optimal

Graphs
- Implemented with adjacency matrices or lists
- Breadth first search searches neighbouring nodes first using a queue
- Depth first search searches one path first using an (implicit) stack via recursion

Stacks/Queues
- Stacks are last in first out (stack of plates)
- Queues are first in first out (queue of people)
- Can both be implemented with arrays/linked lists

Heaps
- Efficient implementation of priority queue (insert and extract min/max)
- Partially ordered using a binary tree where child elements are all greater/smaller than parent
- Binary tree can be implicitly stored in an array with each layer doubling in size
- To add elements, add to last position and swap with parent until high enough
- Min/max can be removed by replacing with last element and swapping with children until low enough
- These operations are linear with the height and logarithmic with number of nodes

Hash Tables
- Unordered map in C++
- Map keys to values using a hash function
- Constant time read/write operations in average case, linear in worst case

Merge Sort
- Splits array in half and recursively calls mergesort until only single elements are left
- Sorted smaller arrays are merged together by taking the smallest element of each sorted array repeatedly
- Merging is linear with with the number of elements and the recursion tree is log n deep
- Overall time complexity is n log n
- Linear space complexity as subarrays need to be created in each call

Quick Sort
- Randomly selects an element and swaps all lower elements to left and higher elements to right
- On average, there will be log n recursive calls, with linear work for each partition
- Average case time is n log n with log n space for calls on the stack
- Worst case time is n^2 with n space for calls on the stack
